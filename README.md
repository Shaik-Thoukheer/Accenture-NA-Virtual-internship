Project Overview
In collaboration with Social Buzz, Accenture embarked on a three-month pilot project aimed at addressing some of the most significant challenges the company faces. The main focus areas included auditing big data practices, providing guidance for a successful IPO, and conducting a detailed analysis of the top five most popular content categories on the platform.
